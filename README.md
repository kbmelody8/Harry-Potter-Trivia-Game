6. Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles

Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles:
Fortunately, I managed to implement everything outlined in my wireframes, so there aren't any unresolved issues per se. However, looking back, I believe there's always room for improvement, and I could have enhanced certain aspects further.

Major Hurdles:
One significant challenge I faced was debugging the timer function. It seemed to intermittently skip questions or not provide enough time for players to respond, which was quite frustrating. I learned the importance of taking breaks and stepping away from the screen when encountering prolonged issues. Sometimes, a fresh perspective after a break can lead to a quicker resolution than persisting for hours on end.

Additionally, I realized that incorporating a hint function could greatly improve the user experience. Providing players with hints or clues when they're stuck on a particularly challenging question could make the game more engaging and accessible.

Another hurdle I encountered was the absence of a difficulty level assigned to questions within each category. Instead of questions appearing randomly, assigning difficulty levels could add an extra layer of challenge and strategy to the game. This is something I'd consider implementing in future iterations to enhance the overall gameplay experience.
